should check : 

=> if there is any ambigous identifier before getting all of the map config ids,
including the map;
=> if the line is empty just skip to the next one
=> after gothring the map config ids , and make sure they are all valid ,
should looking for the map data , therefor if any ambigous item is found but the map item its invalid map 

so the conditions for this check is : 
if all_done >= 6 and item != map_item => invalid map data or file
